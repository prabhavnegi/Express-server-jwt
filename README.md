## Express-server-jwt
  This project was made for learning Express , mongodb Atlas , jwt and passport.
  
  游릭 It is a simple api which which we can use to get users and add them.

  游릭 The user can then login with their credentials and it will authenticate and then authorized you a jwt token.
  
  游릭 The jwt token is used to visit the protected route and is used to skip login in again.
  
  游릭 By default jwt expiry is set to 1 hour.
  
  游릭 For authorization, Passport library is used which will verify the jwt token every time we visit the protected route.
 
 
 
 ## Working
 
  ### The api is tested on *Postman*
  
  游댯 A get request http://localhost:5000/users will send a json file conatining all the users.
  
  游댯 To add a new user, a post request to http://localhost:5000/users/add is made with all the details in json format in the body. 
  If succesful will give a response.
  
  游댯 To login , a post request to  http://localhost:5000/users/login with your credentials 
  i.e. email and password in body of the request is made. 
  If user exists it will response with a json data containing your 
  details and a jwt token in the form **'bearer token'**
  
  游댯 Copy the token string and the to check for authorization 
  send a get request to http://localhost:5000/users/protected and add the token in the authorization field.
  **_Note: In the authorization set the type to bearer token_**
